## The FAIRification framework

general intro - what is the framework, why was it developed (highlight iterative process), what are the components

### The FAIRification Process

brief intro to the process 
include FAIRification process diagram

simplified version of the FAIRification process paper - don't need to focus on the validation aspect as we can reference the paper

#### Phase 1: define FAIRification goals

#### Phase 2: examine requirements

#### Phase 3: assess, design, implement, repeat

#### Phase 4: review against the goals


### The FAIRification Template

brief explanation, image & reuse supplementary table 2 from process paper

### The FAIRification Workplan

brief explanation & exemplar (eg CARE) or refer to next section 

## The framework in action

an example project from start to finish - how we set the goals, did anything change after the examination, doing the work, post-assessment. Include diagrams etc as appropriate 


## Practical considerations

* multi-disciplinary task teams
* restate the importance of good goal setting
* flexibility of the framework w/ regards to assessment approaches etc

## Conclusion

> Summerize Key Learnings of the recipe.

### What should I read next?
> * [Tips and Tricks](./tips-tricks.md)
> * [how-to-create-recipe-with-hackmd](./how-to-create-recipe-with-hackmd.md)
> * using a reference tag affored by MyST markdown and sphinx with JupyterBook 0.7+. <!-- {ref}`fcb-intro-fair-principles` -->
